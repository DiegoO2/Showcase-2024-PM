            <h2>What is Jurassic Park</h2>
            <p>Jurassic Park is a revolutionary theme park home to the origins of earth.
                Customers get to experience real dinosaurs which once roamed this earth
                over a million years ago! You and your loved ones can do things such as
                petting a dinosaur, riding one, and feed one! Our scientists have spent
                decades recreating the DNA of these creatures, and we have been able
                to reproduce 15 different species! Creatures such as the Tyrannosaurus,
                Triceratops, and Diplodocus are all present at this park! </p>
